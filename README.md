# 04CodeQuiz

## Description

As a fan of steven universe I wanted to be able to test my knowledge of the show in a eb application quiz. When you go through the quiz Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?



## Usage

When you open the page you click start quiz. Then you go through the quiz.
